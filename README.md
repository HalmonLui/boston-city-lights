## What it does

It displays every streetlight of Boston on a map and gives the option of searching the brightest route or the darkest route home.

## How I did it

The city of Boston has every streetlight record available here: https://data.boston.gov/dataset/streetlight-locations/resource/c2fcc1e3-c38f-44ad-a0cf-e5ea2a6585b5. I used the React.js to create the page, Google Maps for all the map functions, and Node.js as the backend.

## Why I did it

I wanted to do something with the available data the city provides so I thought this interactive map would be a nice way to do it.
